            <strong>Screen Sharing on Mobile:</strong> Currently, mobile devices <strong>cannot share their screen</strong> due to browser and OS restrictions.

            <strong>Viewing from Mobile:</strong> Mobile users <strong>can still view</strong> the screen shared by a desktop user.

          <li>
            <strong>Socket Connection Limitations:</strong> When Peer-to-Peer connection fails and the app falls back to Socket mode, <strong>Video Call</strong> and <strong>Screen Sharing</strong> will be unavailable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connection Drop:</strong> If your network switches (e.g., from Wi-Fi to mobile data), the session may disconnect and need to be re-established.
